About me
======
I am a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology pursuing a Master of Business Analytics, under the supervision of Prof. Dimitris Bertsimas, with whom I do research on Machine Learning and Optimization applied to Healthcare. Before coming to MIT, I obtained a Bachelor of Science in Engineering and a Master of Science in Applied Mathematic from École Centrale Paris (now CentraleSupélec). I have also interned at Wavestone's Machine Learning & Data Lab, as well as at BCG GAMMA, both as a Data Scientist. I will be returning to BCG GAMMA in September 2020 to start my full time career. You can find my resume [here](files/CV_TAZIBOUARDI_HAMZA_UPDATED.pdf)

Research

My research focuses primarily on applying Machine Learning and Optimization to Healthcare problems. You can find an article on the New York Times featuring my model with Michael L. Li  [here](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/22/upshot/coronavirus-models.html?smid=fb-nytimes&smtyp=cur&fbclid=IwAR2Ddh-i_PzUOMOUG21gxGhutUdbQNlvtkU-vei_PXC9vtR4qPjsRxcRGCQ).
