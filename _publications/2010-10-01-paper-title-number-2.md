excerpt: 'One key question in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is understanding the impact of government interventions, and when society can return to normal. To this end, we develop DELPHI, a novel epidemiological model that captures the effect of under-detection and government intervention. We applied DELPHI across 167 geographical areas since early April, and recorded 6% and 11% two-week out-of-sample Median Absolute Percentage Error on cases and deaths respectively. Furthermore, DELPHI successfully predicted the large-scale epidemics in many areas months before, including US, UK and Russia. Using the extracted government response, we find mass gathering restrictions and school closings on average reduced infection rates the most, at 29.9 ± 6.9% and 17.3 ± 6.7%, respectively. The most stringent policy, stay-at-home, on average reduced the infection rate by 74.4 ± 3.7% from baseline across countries that implemented it. We also illustrate how DELPHI can be extended to provide insights on reopening societies under different policies.'
