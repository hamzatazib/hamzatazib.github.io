About me
======
I am a Data Scientist at BCG GAMMA who graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a Master of Business Analytics, under the supervision of Prof. Dimitris Bertsimas, with whom I did research on Machine Learning and Optimization applied to Healthcare. Before going to MIT, I obtained a Bachelor of Science in Engineering and a Master of Science in Applied Mathematics from École Centrale Paris (now CentraleSupélec, part of Paris-Saclay University). I have also interned at Wavestone's Machine Learning & Data Lab, as well as at BCG GAMMA, both as a Data Scientist. You can find my resume [here](files/CV_TAZIBOUARDI_HAMZA_UPDATED.pdf)

Research
======
My research focuses primarily on applying Machine Learning and Optimization to Healthcare problems, and the two main projects on which I have worked on were:

- A Trauma Outcome Predictor (TOP) interpretable model for patients admitted in the ICU after a trauma (blunt or penetration), where the goal was to predict the probability of mortality as well as composite morbidity (any kind of post-surgery complication) and individual morbidities. This project was done in collaboration with Medical Doctors from Massachusetts General Hospital.
- The COVID-19 pandemic, where I was the main developer of the DELPHI epidemiological model that was part, almost since its creation, of the ensemble prediction performed by the CDC. You can find articles published in the New York Times featuring my model with Michael L. Li  [here](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/22/upshot/coronavirus-models.html) and [here](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/12/upshot/coronavirus-models.html), and another one in FiveThirtyEight [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/covid-forecasts/?ex_cid=rrpromo). Our work has also been awarded by C3.ai's Digital Transformation Institute ($5.4 Millions split between 26 projects) for data-driven COVID-19 research (see [here](https://www.zdnet.com/article/c3-ais-digital-transformation-institute-issues-awards-for-data-driven-covid-19-research/)).
